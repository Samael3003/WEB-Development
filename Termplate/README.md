If a terminal alternative of certain gui app exist and it is pretty much good then I prefer using that.

To make your own, make sure you have [Python 3](https://python.org) installed on your system as well as [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) Python Package Manager.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once that's complete, we can start the webpage by running

And its now running on localhost:8000

You can easily change and add variables in the **user.yml** file.
Enjoy your cool terminal interface portofolio.
