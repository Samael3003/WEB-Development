# Staying Sharp with Angular.js Watch Us Build

*We changed the name of this series to "Watch Us Build," so you may see an occasional reference to its former name ("Soup to Bits") in this repository.*

This repo contains the app built in the [Watch Us Build episode](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/build-a-note-taking-app-with-angularjs) for the [Staying Sharp with Angular.js course](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/staying-sharp-with-angular-js).

There is a branch called `starting` that can be used as a starting point for the video. Feel free to clone down this repo and follow along.

# Running the Node App

I used node `0.10.28` at the time of writing the app. We're only using express and lodash, so any version of node (or io.js) should work. You simply need to type: `npm start` in your terminal to start it up.
